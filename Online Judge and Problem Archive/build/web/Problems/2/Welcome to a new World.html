			You will be given three number A , B , C and you will have to guess the operation such that A (operation) B = C.If there are multiple soultion print all of them.
			In the same order stated above.If there is no operation that satisfies the expression A (operation) B then print "?".See the sample output for exact output format.
			You can always assume  A B C will always fit into 32 bit numbers.
